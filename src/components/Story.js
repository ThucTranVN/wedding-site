    <span>We are fond of traveling to Dalat, the location where I proposed。</span>
    <span>We enjoy viewing travel vlogs, romantic films, and enjoying our rice paper (which she prefers the most) while watching。</span>
    <span>It was inevitable that there would be discord in our lives after we lived together。</span>
    <span>I am inclined to be logical, while she is inclined to be emotive。</span>
    <span>She is impatient, and I am slow-tempered.。</span>
    <span>Fortunately, we have the ability to regain our composure and evaluate the situation in a timely manner, as well as to express our emotions and subsequently adapt to one another following each disagreement.。</span>
    <span>A good personal connection is the outcome of getting along and interacting. We are willing to provide love and energy to one another, and we are always appreciative.。</span>`,

    <span>I have never been a man enjoy flirting, or chatting, or, indeed, talking at all. But with her, conversation has always been easy。</span>
    <span>Your laughter brings me joy. To meet a beautiful girl is one thing, but to meet your best friend in the most beautiful girl is something entirely apart。</span>
    <span>I understand that friendship is the best possible foundation a marriage can have。</span>
    <span>In my heart, we've been married for a long time, and this has been our daily routine。</span>
    <span>We will be more devoted to one another in the future and will meticulously preserve this relationship。</span>
    <span>Share both joys and challenges, collaborate, and strive diligently for our glorious future!。</span>`,
